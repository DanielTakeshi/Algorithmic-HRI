# Algorithmic-HRI
My final project for CS 294-115, then hopefully I can build on it for later.

Steps:

(1) Play games and gather data, using [TODO describe]

(2) Now run the preprocessing script to generate the dataset, to be used for
training classifier from (sequence of frames) -> one action (for the
action taken based on the last frame in the sequence of frames), OR we can store
those as datapoints.

(3) Also don't forget checkpoint replay.

(4) Then run training scripts.

TODO clean this up ...
