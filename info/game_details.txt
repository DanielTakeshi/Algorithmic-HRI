A simple text file to remind myself about game details.

A word on actions: even if I press very fast on my keyboard, I can usually at
best get the action to repeat two frames, not one frame. So I **think** it will
be OK if we just search for the next single action to take after some time steps
have passed after the frame.

Idea 1: for all games, should we just disable the NO-OP action? Otherwise I'll get
so many of those actions it doesn't make sense.

Idea 2: for Breakout and games where fire happens very infrequently (note: this
is not the case for Space Invaders) we should just hard-code that in? EDIT: No,
don't do that! Just set the policy to play random actions \epsilon-percent of
the time. That will let us fire, and it doesn't make a difference in Breakout.

Idea 3: eliminate the first 20 frames of the game. No action usually happens for
those (in Breakout I press really fast but it still takes nearly that amount of
time for the act to register). Or I can just ignore this, it's likely not a big
deal. Also, don't remove actions at the end, because there is no lag, i.e. I
can keep moving LEFT in Breakout at the end, and the game WILL register that. So
don't crop off at the end.

I thought I'd add this to prevent myself from messing up every now and then.
Follow these guidelines:

1. Make sure the directories are clean, numbered consecutively, etc.

2. For games like Breakout, only use LEFT and RIGHT, and try to use LEFT/RIGHT
very frequently, to maximize the amount of data with those.

3. Don't conflate FIRE with LEFT/RIGHT, especiall for Breakout, unless it's for
games like Space Invaders where it's unavoidable.

4. After EVERY game is over, inspect the output files making sure everything
proceeded as normal, nothing out of the ordinary. If so, you better delete some
files!

Actions:
NO-OP (coded as "0")
FIRE (coded as "1") 
LEFT (coded as "4")
RIGHT (coded as "3")
FIRE LEFT (coded as "12")
FIRE RIGHT (coded as "11")

The FIRE will be tricky to train, maybe force it? It only happens on the order
of 5 times per game and if we do it more often it has no effect.

Also, ack, I just saw FIRE LEFT and FIRE RIGHT. Whatever you do, make sure you
don't move left while firing! That will trigger those extra actions. We
**really** want it to be only 0s, 1s, 3s, and 4s, and then in training I'll dump
the 1s (and maybe even the 0s).
